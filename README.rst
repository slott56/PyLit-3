############
PyLit 3.1
############

This is a rewrite of PyLit from Python 2 to Python 3.

The output is almost identical to Python 2, with minor tweaks to remave tailing
spaces.

See http://slott56.github.io/PyLit-3/index.html for the complete documentation.

The ``Makefile`` is used via ``make html`` to rebuild the code and documentation.

The ``rstdocs`` directory contains the documentation, plus many examples.

The ``src`` directory contains the installable module plus a ``setup.py`` file.

The ``test`` directory contains the unit test suite.

The ``contribs`` directory are old contributed modules which have not yet been
converted to Python3.

The code repository is: https://github.com/slott56/PyLit-3
