The PyLit documentation itself is built with Sphinx. It includes the text
version of several modules.

Here's the test procedure. Note the ``cd`` to change directories. This
assures that PyLit is found in the ``../src`` directory.

..  parsed-literal::

    cd test
    python3 pylit_test.py
    python3 pylit_ui_test.py

You can also use tox to run a suite of tests.

..  parsed-literal::

    tox

Here's part of the documentation build procedure. It uses PyLit to create source for the documentation.

-   Clone a new document from ``docs/index.txt``

-   Clone a new example from ``src/pylit.py``

-   Clone a new example from ``test/pylit_test.py``

..  parsed-literal::

    python3 src/pylit.py docs/conf.py
    python3 src/pylit.py src/pylit.py docs/examples/pylit.py.txt
    python3 src/pylit.py --comment-string='## ' test/pylit_test.py docs/examples/pylit_test.py.txt

After this, we can manually run Sphinx to rebuild the documentation.

..  parsed-literal::

    sphinx-build docs _build/html

We can do this wih the included Makefile, which also converts all of the
tutorials and examples.
