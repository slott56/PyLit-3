Requirements for installation::

  from distutils.core import setup

Module Definition::

  setup(name='PyLit',
        version='3.1',
        description='Python Literate Programming',
        author='S.Lott',
        author_email='slott56@gmail.com',
        url='https://github.com/slott56/PyLit-3',
        py_modules=['pylit'],
        license='GNU General Public License (v. 2 or later)',
       )

And that's it. This will be installed into the site-packages directory.

Technically, this isn't necessary.  A simple copy will do.
Further, the :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` environment variable can name a directory
that has :file:`pylit.py` in it.
